--- GENERAL ---

This is Pomelo, a tool that allows you to calculate set voronoi tesselations. 
If you want to learn about set voronoi diagramms, please refer to http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786435.2013.834389#.Vulxk9qdJLU  (DOI:10.1080/14786435.2013.834389) where the algorithm is described.

It has been written by Simon Weis and Philipp Schoenhoefer at the Institute For Theoretical Physics 1 of the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen.
The development of this software was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) Forschergruppe FOR1548 "Geometry and Physics of Spatial Random Systems" (GPSRS).

Pomelo is free software. (released under GPL3, see Licence for details). While Pomelo is licenced under GPL3, external libraries (in the folder lib) may be licenced differently.
